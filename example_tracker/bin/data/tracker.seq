# like in old tracker, steps goes from up to down
# - , _ , ~ or | is no message
# each column is a sequence output 
# in this case they are all used as triggers
# by putting an 'x' after the value you can set the chance
# 1.0 is 100% chance 
# ...and obiviously # is for commenting out lines!
# all the strings ofToFloat() parses are valid as value
# for example: 0.0, 0.2, .3, 1, 0, .0, etc
# you can switch the sequence start and number of step from the gui
# useful to memorize more sequence into the same file, like this:
#
#--seq1 steps 0-15--
